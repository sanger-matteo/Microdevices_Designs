This repository contains a collection of files used for the creation of microfluidic masks and photolithography work.

## Description of files
This repository includes several scripts used in the study. Below is a brief overview of each:
- **Lithography - Fabrication protocols**:
	- Contains files with different protocols used for the treatment of Si-wafers, photoresist, and fabrication processes for photolithography of microfluidic molds
- **Mask Designs**: if the file are not metric unit, assume *1 unit = 1 micrometer*
	- *Designs:* the *.dwg* and *.dxf* files drawn in CAD that outline the design of different microfluidic designs 
	- *Orders:* similar to "Deasigns", it contains the final *.dwg* and *.dxf* designed used to order and print photolithographhy masks (mostly negative).
- **3D_Nanolithography:**
	- It contains both the *.dwg* and *.stl* of microfluidic molds created via 3D-printing nanolithography.
